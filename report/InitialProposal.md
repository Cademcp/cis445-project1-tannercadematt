#MLB Postseason Roster Display
##Authors: Tanner, Cade and Matt
The topic that we plan to learn about is the language Python, with emphasis on web application development. We will look into using the Flask library to create an API, and integrate a NoSQL database called MongoDB into our web application as well. The front end of the website will be written in HTML and use Bootstrap as a framework. The website will display an MLB team postseason roster that will include players and their individual information such as height, weight, age, and number. We will also try and incorporate a viewable picture of each player. The back end of the site will be written in Python and use Flask as the API framework. The MongoDB NoSQL database will store the players and their information. Our group selected this project with the objectives of learning how to program in Python, how to create a website using Python, and how to integrate a database with a Python based web API. Our first milestone is to learn the basics of how to code in Python by 10/3. Our second milestone would be fully integrating the front end, back end, and database by 10/4.The following milestone is creating the database and familirizes ourselves with its basic functions by 10/7. The next milestone would be completing the front end of the website using HTML by 10/9. In general Cade will be the one designing the front end of the website. I(Tanner) will be writing the Python code on the back end. Lastly Matt will be completeting the database. Our website will then be fully completed by the 10/10 milestone date and we will complete the project report by the 10/16 milestone date.
