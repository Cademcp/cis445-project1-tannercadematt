# CIS445 Project 1 (Group Project)

The objective of this project is to learn new programming languages, programming paradigms, technologies, etc. in all Computer Science related areas/domains. Also, you will learn how to work on the same project simultaneously in a distributed manner through Git/GitHub and how to handle the conflicts when you commit/push your changes to the remote repository.

You will **compare the newly learned materials with the existing ones** (what you have learned before), analyze their pros and cons, provide the use cases for both, and also produce/write some sample code. Also, **all the references used should be provided and clearly presented in the project**; i.e., you have to distinguish what you copy-and-paste from online resources to the one you actually produce/develop by yourselves.

An example of the project is the study of different data exchange formats/frameworks/mechanisms, such as 

1. JSON (what we have learned)

1. Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

1. [Apache Thrift software framework](https://thrift.apache.org/)

1. [Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org/)

The following references provide some insights and detail analysis on them.

1. [Encoding and Evolution](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/ch04.html)

1. [Schema evolution in Avro, Protocol Buffers and Thrift](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2012/12/05/schema-evolution-in-avro-protocol-buffers-thrift.html)

And the comparison and the use case can be found here.

1. [Serializarion Frameworks](https://ganges.usc.edu/pgroupW/images/a/a9/Serializarion_Framework.pdf)

1. [How Uber Engineering Evaluated JSON Encoding and Compression Algorithms to Put the Squeeze on Trip Data](https://eng.uber.com/trip-data-squeeze/)

## Deliverables

1. In-class presentations (put in **presentation** folder)

1. A short report (5 - 10 pages) (put in **report** folder)

1. Sample code ((put in **code** folder)

## Rubric

1. Each member of the group should contribute to the project. The grades of individuals will be based on the activities and partitipation of the project.
